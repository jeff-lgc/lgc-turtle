1) Do you have a HackerRank, CodeWars, StackOverflow, GitHub, Project Euler, etc account that you'd like us to have a look at?

No, I have no private projects to share.



2) Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it.

Information Dashboard Design: Displaying Data for At-A-Glance Monitoring
ISBN: 978-1938377006

This book was an invaluable resource when working on V2 of Benefacts Analytics, specifically the Scorecard dashboard
designed to present at-a-glance information on financial, governance and risk information for portfolios of and
individual non-profit organisations.

Needing to understand how people take in complex information quickly, this book provided guidance on layout,
structure and use of colour. Delving deeper there is useful advice on what visualisations to use for different
types of data.

Much of what is covered might be considered common-sense but I find it is often useful to throw away what I think
I know about a subject, and go back to basics.


3) Tell us about why you consider LetsGetChecked to be the right move for you.

Having spent five fulfilling years working in the non-profit sector, I feel a move back to a commercial setting
is appropriate at this time. I have implemented all of Benefacts key projects twice, and find myself
needing a new challenge; I am tiring of re-implementing similar business requirements with new technologies.
